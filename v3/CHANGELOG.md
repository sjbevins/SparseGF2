# Changelog (SparseGF2 v3)

## 3.0.0.dev1: milestone 1, foundations

* Audit of v2 (`docs/AUDIT.md`) and the v3 design proposal (`docs/DESIGN.md`).
* `PauliString`: immutable Pauli operators with exact phases, Stim's notation
  and sign conventions; products, commutation, matrices, Stim conversion.
* `Clifford`: k-qubit Clifford unitaries as signed tableaux; conjugation,
  composition, inverse, symplectic matrix, conjugation tables, Stim conversion.
  Canonical, Stim-independent indexing of the 24 one-qubit and 11,520
  two-qubit Cliffords (`Clifford.from_index`, `Clifford.index`,
  `random_clifford_indices`).
* `gate()` / `all_gates()`: every one- and two-qubit Clifford unitary in Stim
  (46 gates plus aliases), identical names and conventions.
* Test suite (156 tests, plus doctests) checking all of the above against Stim, plus
  Stim-independent checks against dense matrices.
* `benchmarks/prototypes/`: the layout prototypes behind the kernel design.
